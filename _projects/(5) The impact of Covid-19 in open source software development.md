# The impact of Covid-19 in open source software development

A global health emergency, the coronavirus (covid-19) crisis has turned the tide for all populations. The solutions put in place by governments and companies to contain the crisis, including containment and teleworking, have also changed professional habits. In this work, we will investigate the impact of Covid-19 in open source development ecosystems on GitHub. Starting with the construction of a large data set on the subject, we will be conducting experiments in order to understand what this crisis has generated and its impact on the habits, productivity of developers.

In this project, our objective is to gather and analyze various communication data in software development towards learning contributions and relate them to the characteristics of the software products and processes.
